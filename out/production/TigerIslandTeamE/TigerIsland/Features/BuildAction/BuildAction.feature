Feature: BuildAction

  Scenario: Successful build new settlement
    Given A board with a tile placed on it
    And I have initialized a player in BuildActionDefinitions
    When I attempt to build a settlement on a non-volcano tile
    Then A meeple is placed on that hexagon

  Scenario: Build new settlement fails because its on a volcano
    Given A board with a tile placed on it
    When I attempt to build a settlement on a volcano tile
    Then The tile place fails

  Scenario: Build new settlement fails because its past Level 1
    Given A board with a tile placed on it, and all hexagons set to Level 2
    When I attempt to build a settlement on a level 2 non-volcano tile
    Then The tile place fails

#  Scenario: Build new settlement fails because there are already meeples on the hexagon
#    Given A board with a tile placed on it
#    And I have initialized a player in BuildActionDefinitions
#    And each non-volcano tile has a meeple on it
#    When I attempt to build a settlement on an occupied non-volcano tile
#    Then The tile place fails
#    And There is still a meeple in the target Hexagon
#
#  Scenario: Build new settlement fails because there are already another player's meeples on hexagon
#    Given A board with a tile placed on it
#    And I have initialized two players in BuildActionDefinitions
#    And Each non-volcano hexagon has a meeple from a different player on it
#    When I attempt to build a settlement on a non-volcano tile
#    Then The tile place fails
#
#  Scenario: Develop settlement fails because no valid adjacent hexagon selected
#    Given A board with a volcano, jungle, and rock tile
#    And I have initialized a player in BuildActionDefinitions
#    And A meeple on the rock hexagon
#    When I attempt to develop settlement choosing the meeple settlement and Grassland
#    Then The settlement size should still be 0
#
#  Scenario: Develop settlement places meeples in exactly one territory
#    Given A board with a volcano, jungle, and rock tile
#    And I have initialized a player in BuildActionDefinitions
#    And A meeple on the rock hexagon
#    When I attempt to develop settlement choosing the meeple settlement and Rock
#    Then A meeple is placed on the rock hexagon
#    And The proper amount of meeples are depleted from the player's supply
#
#  Scenario: Develop settlement places meeples in two adjacent territories
#    Given A board with a volcano, beach, and rock hexagons on a tile
#    And Volcano, jungle, and rock on an adjacent tile.
#    And The adjacent tile is placed such the rock hexagon touches the old rock & beach hexagons
#    And the jungle hexagon touches the beach hexagon
#    And there is a meeple on the beach hexagon
#    When I attempt to develop settlement choosing the meeple settlement and "rock"
#    Then A meeple is placed on each rock hexagon
#    And exactly two meeple are depleted from the player's supply
#
#  Scenario: Develop settlement places meeples in two territories, one using flood fill
#    Given A board with a volcano, beach, and rock hexagons on a tile
#    And Volcano, jungle, and rock on an adjacent tile.
#    And The adjacent tile is placed such the rock hexagon touches the old rock hexagon
#    And there are no other adjacencies between tiles
#    And there is a meeple on the beach hexagon
#    When I attempt to develop settlement choosing the meeple settlement and "rock"
#    Then A meeple is placed on each rock hexagon
#    And exactly two meeple are depleted from the player's supply
#
#  Scenario: Develop settlement fails due to insufficient meeples
#    Given A board with a volcano, beach, and rock hexagons on a tile
#    And Volcano, jungle, and rock on an adjacent tile.
#    And The adjacent tile is placed such the rock hexagon touches the old rock & beach hexagons
#    And the jungle hexagon touches the beach hexagon
#    And there is a meeple on the beach hexagon
#    And the player has exactly one meeple left
#    When I attempt to develop settlement choosing the meeple settlement and "rock"
#    Then The tile place fails
#
#  Scenario: Build Totoro fails because there is not a big enough settlement
#    Given A board with a tile placed on it
#    When I attempt to place a Totoro on a non-volcano hexagon
#    Then The tile place fails
#
#  Scenario: Attempt to place Totoro on volcano hexagon
#    Given A board with a tile placed on it
#    When I attempt to place a Totoro on a volcano hexagon
#    Then The tile place fails
#
#  Scenario: Build Totoro fails because there is not a big enough settlement adjacent
#    Given A board with 8 non-volcano hexagons connected in a straight line
#    And The first five from some index have meeples from the same player's
#    When I attempt to place a Totoro on the last hexagon from that index
#    Then The tile place fails
#
#  Scenario: Build Totoro fails because there is already a Totoro in an adjacent settlement
#    Given A board with 6 non-volcano hexagons connected in a straight line
#    And The first five from some index have meeples from the same player
#    And The next hexagon has a totoro from the same player
#    When The player attempts to add another totoro adjacent to this settlement
#    Then The tile place fails
#
#  Scenario: Build Totoro is successful
#    Given A board with 8 non-volcano hexagons connected in a straight line
#    And The first five from some index have meeples from the same player's
#    When I attempt to place a Totoro on the sixth hexagon from that index
#    Then The sixth Hexagon now has a Totoro on it
#    And the player now has one less Totoro
#    And the player has 200 more points
#
#  Scenario: One player uses all of their pieces
#    Given A player has 1 Meeples and 0 Totoros
#    When That player places their last meeple
#    Then The game is immediately over and the scores are compared
#
#  Scenario: One player uses all of their pieces
#    Given A player has 0 Meeples and 1 Totoros
#    And There is a board with 6 connection non-volcano spaces on it
#    And 5 of those have the playerâ€™s meeples on them
#    When That player places their last Totoro
#    Then The game is immediately over and the scores are compared
#    Then The operation should fail
